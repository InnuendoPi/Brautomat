# Brautomat for ESP8266

[![de](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-de-green.svg)](https://github.com/InnuendoPi/Brautomat32)

Brautomat is a brewing controller for GGM IDS induction hobs with an ESP32 Wemos D1 mini. Brautomat is used in the brewery by hobby brewers and offers intuitive, easy-to-use controls. During mashing, rest temperatures are reached automatically and the rest times are adhered too. Brautomat also supports the the boiling process of the wort and adding hops. In an ascending infusion mash process, the brautomat can fully automate the mashing process.

_Note: induction hobs from other manufacturers than GGM IDS are not supported._

_Note: please use german manual with browser translation._

## 💻 Nextion HMI Touchdisplay

Brautomat offers three different displays:

* Overview
* Mash tun
* Manual control cooking

_Note: the display is an optional extension. Only Nextion ITEAD HMI 3.5" Touchdisplays are supported._

## ▶️ Installation

Hardware driver CP210x USB to UART Bridge Virtual COM Port (VCP): [Silicon Labs](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads)

* Download [Firmeware.zip](tools/Firmware.zip)
* unzip Firmware.zip
* open command line (cmd.exe) and change into firmware.zip directory
* start script "flashen.cmd"

Script flashen.cmd use [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool).

## 🗺️ Multilingual

Brautomat32 supports (almost) any number of languages. Each language has its own language file. The language files in JSON format are stored in the folder data/language.

_Supported the project and translated the Brautomat into a new language or corrected existing language files!_

## 📙 Circuit board 2.0

![Platine](docs/img/Platine20.jpg)

A board for the Arduino ESP controller is available. In addition to the screw terminal blocks for the GPIOs, the board also offers a separate connection for the induction hob and three connections for temperature sensors. The Gerber file is stored in the Tools folder. The board 2.0 can be operated with both the ESP8266 and the ESP32.

## Pinout

The ESP32 D1 offers a pinout suitable for the ESP8266 (GPIO D0 to D8). The pin assignment shown is based on the ESP32 D1 Mini NodeMCU module from [AZ-Delivery](https://www.az-delivery.de/products/esp32-d1-mini)
